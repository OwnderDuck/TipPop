Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out.
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
Deleted code is debugged code.
The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
Good code is its own best documentation.
The function of good software is to make the complex appear simple.
Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.
Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday’s code.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state.
The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.
A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take.
The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there.
The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late.
The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.
The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.
The best programs are the ones written when the programmer is supposed to be working on something else.
