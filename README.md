## Introduction

TipPop is a lightweight browser extension that displays random tips with animation in the lower-left corner of a webpage. It appears when the page starts loading and automatically disappears 1.145 seconds after the page has fully loaded, ensuring it doesnâ€™t interfere with your browsing experience. You can import your own tips to create personalized content.
